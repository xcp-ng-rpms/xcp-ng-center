RPM sources for the xcp-ng-center package in XCP-ng (https://xcp-ng.org/).

**This package has been retired in XCP-ng 8.0.**

Reason: we don't provide it anymore in RPM form. It causes useless updates and simply contains an installer for Windows which can be easily downloaded from https://github.com/xcp-ng/xenadmin/releases/latest.
